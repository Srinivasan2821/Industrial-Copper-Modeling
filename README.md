# INDUSTRIAL COPPER MODELING
# _Project  By - Srinivasan P._

Exploring skewness and outliers in the dataset.

Transform the data into a suitable format and perform any necessary cleaning and pre-processing steps.

ML Regression model which predicts continuous variable ‘Selling_Price’.

ML Classification model which predicts Status: WON or LOST.

Creating a streamlit page where you can insert each column value and you will get the Selling_Price predicted value and Status(Won/Lost).
